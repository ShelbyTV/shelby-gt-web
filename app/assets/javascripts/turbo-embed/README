Turbo-Embed (named "turbo" b/c it works asynchronously and has lag like a turbocharger)

designed for avc.com with the intention of being broadly applicable

1) Embed turbo-bootstrap.js on your page
2) You're done!  The embed will find previously rolled videos on your page and enhance them

Shelby Embed Player

(for avc.com)


1) JS tag integrates into current workflow
  - set-it-and-forget-it style JS tag added to body of template (both avc.com and individual pages)
    - * use the state of the art for JS includes w/o adversely affecting performance *
    - the JS would need to reference username:fredwilson
    - for each shelby-supported video embedded on that page, query our API to see if it's posted to fredwilson.public_roll
      - A) if it was rolled, replace that embed with our embed (focused on that single video; see #2)
        and/or
      - B) enhance the embed (promoting their roll on Shelby; see #3)
          - seems like a good option if A is too much work for the given time
      
2) Replace original embed (with Shelby embed)
  - probably want to embed the entire shelby app 
    - with some UI adjustments for size
    - with minor UX adjustments since we're in-page
  - this embed could also be embedded manually, without the JS from #1
    
3) Enhance original embed (linking to Shelby)
  - add some stuff around the embed already in the page, instead of replacing it with our player
  - this added stuff would promote fredwilson.shelby.tv (or fredwilson.tv)
    - shows other available videos
    - marketing like "playback all his video, like TV"
    - could also promote emailing the video (via Shelby Mail)
