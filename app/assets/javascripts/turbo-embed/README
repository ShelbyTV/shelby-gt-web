=== Turbo-Embed ===

(named "turbo" b/c it works asynchronously and has lag like a turbocharger)

designed for avc.com with the intention of being broadly applicable

NB: This is *not* a Shelby player embed.  Once one is developed, turbo cold be used to replace
  the youtube player embed with a shelby player embed.  But until then, we're just promoting 
  the host page's user's other videos, rolls, etc.
FYI: The actual Shelby player embed should be called Supercharger-Embed (or Super-Embed).  This is 
  called turbo b/c it has lag like a turbocharger.  An actual embed would be in the host page, 
  delivering it's value immediately, like a supercharger.



== Host Pages ==

1) Embed turbo-bootstrap.js on a host page / blog template
2) Fill in the required parameters (currently: user id)
#) You're done!  The embed will find previously rolled videos on your page and enhance them



== Front End Development ==

1) app/javascripts/turbo.js is the first thing loaded onto the host page by our snippet
    - this JS includes a few things for support: underscore, turbo JSTs
    - also loads and executes our actual workhorse:
2) app/javascripts/turbo-embed/turbo.js.erb
    - does the parsing of the page 
    - for each embed found, fires a requests to the front end:
3) app/controllers/turbo_embed_controller.rb
    - receives one request per embed on the page
    - we could do anything, but right now we're checking to see if that video was rolled by the given
      user and if so, rendering some embellishments:
4) app/views/turbo_embed/embellish.js.erb
    - makes use of the templates *already loaded* on the host page (via step #1, above)
    - adds adornments to the embed element (which it finds via a unique tag added by turbo.js in step #2)
