Turbo-Embed (named "turbo" b/c it works asynchronously and has lag like a turbocharger)

designed for avc.com with the intention of being broadly applicable

1) Embed turbo-bootstrap.js on a host page
2) You're done!  The embed will find previously rolled videos on your page and enhance them

NB: This is *not* a Shelby player embed.  Once one is developed, turbo cold be used to replace
the youtube player embed with a shelby plyaer embed.  But until then, we're just promoting 
the host page's user's other videos, rolls, etc.
